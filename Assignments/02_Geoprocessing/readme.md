I sourced my data from my personal camera roll, selecting photos taken in San Francisco between 2022 and 2025. I wrote a script `img-to-geojson.py` that extracts metadata from the photos in `/img` and writes the filename, coordinates, and timestamp to `photos.geojson`.

I then wrote a simple mapbox script in `index.html` that serves a local interactive photo web map.

The photos in my own dataset are quite personal. While the subjects appear deeply unserious, ranging from a rotting peach to an ad for a sex shop, they evoke visceral memories of the time and place they were taken. My role the collection is evident: they are 'the view from me'. They compose a constellation of memoribilia: small moments of surprise, glimpses of wonder. They document a practice of noticing. Altogether the webmap forms a collage that tells a narrative, mysterious to any user besides myself.

I propose to create a related datset using the Google streetview API to extract a streetview photo at each photo's geolocation. I wish to contrast my personally situated photo album with a generic view of the same places: 'the view from nowhere.' What renders my photos meaningful is in their metadata (time and place), but also so much more: the subjectivity of my experience, the senses beyond sight incapable of being captured by the camera, the contextualized knowledge of how seemingly disparate phenomena weave the political and aesthetic fabric of local neighborhoods. In other words, how they compose a place, San Francisco, in all its beauty and contradictions. It is my belief that a corporate project to map the world, manifesting in cars awkwardly fitted with bulky technology conducting mass surveillance sweeps of the city, is simply incapable of telling this story. Subject imposes itself on object, and when the subject is not performing an act of noticing but rather an agenda of extraction, the representation of the object becomes sterilized and devoid of meaning. It is the metadata of a million places, and nothing more. "If you try to say everything, you say nothing."
